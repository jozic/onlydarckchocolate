# Chocolate Casper

The default Casper theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) modified to be used at http://onlydarkchocolate.com.

## Changes compared to original Casper (v 1.3.1)
 - image posts on main page
 - disqus comments
 - twitter typeahead search by post titles
 - Open Sans is used everywhere, no Merriweather (default Times New Roman in ios browsers is a deal breaker for serif fonts :( )
 
## Build zip

`zip -r ChocolateCasper.zip ChocolateCasper -x *.git*`
